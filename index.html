            Jim is an exceptionally creative and highly flexible professional with more than twelve
            years of experience. His expertise lies not only in designing, coding, testing, and
            debugging programs for clients' specific needs, but also in providing excellent customer
            service, sales, and tutorship. Jim has successfully partnered with professional
            managers, computer science students, artists, and persons with special needs to provide
            training, technical solutions, and direct support.

            What sets Jim apart is his ability to see the big picture; he understands that
            technology is not an end unto itself but a tool that can be used to achieve business
            goals and objectives. With this perspective in mind he is always able to provide sound
            advice as well as innovative technical solutions that meet the client's specific
            needs.</p>
        <p> Jim's intelligence and creativity set him apart from the pack, and he strives to use
            them to the best of his ability. He is motivated by a desire to help others, and
            believes that through teamwork, anything is possible. </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Jim has always been a passionate learner. He didn't follow the traditional path of
            going to college and getting a degree, but instead chose the courses that interested him
            and which he enjoyed. By picking up odd jobs and delivering pizza for his local shop,
            Jim worked his way through college.

            North Carolina State University chose to end Jim's enrollment, as he was earning too
            many credits-by-examination. However, this hasn't stopped him from continuing his
            education. Jim takes online courses through Coursera and Youtube lectures, as well as
            subscribing directly to professors on Patreon. His interests range from art to
            economics, mathematics to classic literature - there's nothing that Jim doesn't want
            to learn about!

        <h3>Flutter Developer - <a href="https://github.com/JimBruntOfRaleigh/NAAHRF">National

            </span>

            Lead developer and designer for the NAAHRF's cross platform mobile app redesign.
            Used Greg Ulmer's metaphysics
            of Electracy, an aesthetic theory that
            understands a user’s interaction with a
            smart phone app to be a process of material
            semiosis that travels along the axis of
            attraction and repulsion. The process of
            material semiosis is when something is
            changed because of a sign. What I am trying
            to change with this app is the user’s apprehensions, fears,
            and repulsion to the process of properly
            hiring a contractor for home repairs.
